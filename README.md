# AWS-assessement Description

### Assuming you were tasked with building a new feature for an existing cloud-based, distributed web application that allows customers to register for a newsletter.
 
### The User is presented with a simple page with an input field for an email address and a subscribe button. When the user clicks subscribe the client calls an api endpoint to store the email address.
 
### How would you build this feature using AWS?
 
Our Expectation
1. A valid solution requires at least a front end, a backend(API)with a business logic and a storage component
2. Correct use of different AWS technologies to provide a valid, efficient and cost-effective solution
3. Either a back or front data entry validation AND validation of the user provided email existance or not on our records (storage component)
4. Use Git to manage code base 5- Use any language you are most comfortable with. This should take a few hours of your time, but you may take 7 days to complete the solution.
